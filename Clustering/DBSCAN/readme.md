DBSCAN :

- Eliminate noise points
	- Perform clustering on the remaining points
		> Put an edge between all core points which are within Eps
		> Make each group of core points as a cluster
		> Assign border point to one of the clusters of its associated core points

K-Means 👍

1. Initialize centroids – This is done by randomly choosing K no of points, the points can be present in the dataset or also random points.
2. Assign Clusters – The clusters are assigned to each point in the dataset by calculating their distance from the centroid and assigning it to the centroid with minimum distance.
3. Re-calculate the centroids – Updating the centroid by calculating the centroid of each cluster we have created.
