## What to do

- Use training file to train 
(1) basic,
(2) reward and punishment, 
(3) pocket and 
(4) kesler’s reconstruction

- No. of features will be variable

- No. of classes will be > 3 for kesler’s algorithm

- Use test file to evaluate the performance and identify the misclassified samples

- Use different training and testing data files during evaluation

- This instruction and data files (both linearly separable and non-separable) will be uploaded to moodle as well

- Try to verify your code using other available data sets

- Upload  your source code to moodle by **10 pm on next Sunday**

**Copy checker will be used. Be careful to avoid negative marking.**
