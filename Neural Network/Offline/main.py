# single layer network

# Add a Layer class
# Create an instance for eah layer, and take the structure defined in the text file

# weights will be hard coded for now

# There will be 4 activation algo.
# 1. Sigmoid 2, unit step func. 3. RELU 4. softmax 5. study other literature

# create a forward pass, 64 samples batch, and train the network
# repeat until all the training samples are exhausted.

# test using the test file and calculate the accuracy for hard-coded weights and bias.

# --------- 

# calculate the error rate, and based on that, implement the gradient descent algo.
# using the gradient descent, adjust the weights and bias to get maximum fit of data.
